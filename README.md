telepsketch
===========

This is an Arduino sketch that I put together to develop a binary protocol over the
serial port to allow incoming commands and outgoing sensor readings.

This is part of the minion v3 project.

NOTE: there are a couple of files missing from this project: the DHT library to support the 
Arduino sketch and the packet parsing code for the client command script. I didn't want to 
duplicate these files from other projects. 

You can find the DHT library code at: https://github.com/FellowRoboticists/wireless_sensor_xmit

You can find the packet parsing code at: https://github.com/FellowRoboticists/create-oi

I apologize for the inconvenience.
